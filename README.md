# Wheels Up
This application allows users to lookup countries to visit, track countries they have visited and want to visit in the future. Users can search by first letter, world region, or by typing in the name of a country. Once searched, a list of countries display that fit the search criteria. The user can then add it to the list of countries they want to visit or they can see more information about that country (flag image, currency, language, etc.). Users can also make notes about their travels or travel plans at the bottom of the app as well.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Heroku [here](https://wheels-up.herokuapp.com/).
